## WAYS TO OBTAIN RANDOM NUMBERS WITH THE REQUIRED LAW DISTRIBUTIONS
#### (Part 2. Continuous random variables)

        GOAL OF THE WORK:
        1.Practical mastering of methods for obtaining random
          quantities having a continuous distribution.

        2. Development of software sensors for discrete random
          quantities.

        3. Evaluation of modeling accuracy: calculation of mathematical expectation and variance, comparison of the obtained
          estimates with the corresponding theoretical values.

        4. Graphical representation of the distribution density
          and the integral distribution function.
