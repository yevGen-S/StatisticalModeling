## Getting base sequence of pseudo random numbers and tests of their working

        1. Receiving on a computer using a software sensor
          basic sequence of pseudo-random numbers,
          having a uniform distribution.

        2. Mastering the methods of statistical evaluation of the received
          distributions: calculation of empirical values
          for mathematical expectation and variance.

        3. Mastering methods for assessing communication statistics: calculation
          autocorrelation function values ​​ and construction
          correlograms.

        4. Mastering the methods of graphical representation of laws
          distributions: plotting the density function
          distribution and integral distribution function.
