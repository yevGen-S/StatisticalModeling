## Methods for obtaining random numbers with a given law distribution

        1.Practical mastering of methods for obtaining random
        quantities having a discrete distribution.
        
        2. Development of software sensors for discrete random
        quantities.
        
        3. Study of the characteristics of the simulated sensors:
        
            3.1. Estimation of modeling accuracy: calculation of mathematical 
            expectation and variance, comparison of obtained
            estimates with the corresponding theoretical values.
        
        4. Graphical representation of the density function
        distribution and integral distribution function.
